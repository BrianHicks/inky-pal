# Inky Pal!

This is an e-ink status display that I set up during Maryanne Wachter and Sara Bobo's NGW workshop about e-ink displays!

## Some ideas

I kinda want to have a line-art illustration on one side of my display (or maybe as a background?) with calendar information and some oblique strategies or self-care tips.

Here are some public domain animal illustrations I found, which might look OK on an e-ink screen:

## Other Setup Notes

You need to enable the SPI interface on the Pi.
Raspbian provies `raspi-config` from which you can select "Interface options" then "SPI".
